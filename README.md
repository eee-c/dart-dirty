# Dart Dirty

The dart dirty library is persistent [HashMap](https://api.dartlang.org/stable/dart-collection/HashMap-class.html) for Dart.

Create a new database with the constructor:

```dart
var db = new Dirty('test/test.db');
```

Open an existing database with the same constructor:

```dart
var db = new Dirty('test/test.db');
```

Then use the usual `HashMap` methods to add records:

```dart
db['everything'] = {'answer': 42};
```

And to remove records:

```dart
db.remove('everything');
```

To ensure that everything is written to the filesystem, it is best to properly close a database:

```dart
db.close();
```

## Performance

I have not really optimized this yet. Using `readAsLines` to read DB records seems less than ideal, but it actually works fairly well. Writing could probably be sped up if data was buffered more, but I focused on read for the first pass.

If you would like to improve, see the `test/mk_perf_db.dart` and `test/perf.dart` scripts. The former creates a 100,000 record DB and the latter reads it back in. On my machine the former takes ~4 minutes to write and ~10 seconds to read. Performance patches welcome!
